# R Markdown {#RMark}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="My figure caption"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Equations

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1
(\#eq:lm1)
$$

Is the same as:


\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 (\#eq:lm2)
\end{equation}


## Adding a table

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "The mtcars data.")
```

or



| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| A         | 3         | 3         |
| B         | 4         | 2         |
| C         | 5         | 1         |

: this is my table caption

This is some normal text

## Cross-Referencing

To do this we need to change the `YAML` header to a `bookdown` format.

### Figures: {-}

Figure \@ref(fig:pressure) shows the relationship between temperature and pressure.

### Equations {-}

Equations \@ref(eq:lm1) and \@ref(eq:lm2) give the formula for a simple linear regression

### Sections {-}

Section \@ref(RMark) describes a bit about R Markdown.

Note the use of `{-}` above. This indicates that I do not wish the section to be numbered.

## Referencing

We can include a reference to the `akima` package using `[@akima-me]` and ensuring that we have a bibliography file stated in the `YAML` header:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Reproducible Document"
output: html_document
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

In this analysis we used the `akima` package [@akima-me].

Or

@akima-me show in their package that things happen.

Note that I also added a section heading for references to the end of the document.
